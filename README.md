# Khitan Vowel Harmony

The Khitan small script (Chinese: 契丹小字; pinyin: qìdān xiǎozì) was one of two writing systems used for the now-extinct Khitan language. It was used during the 10th–12th century by the Khitan people, who had created the Liao Empire in present-day northeastern China. In addition to the small script, the Khitans simultaneously also used a functionally independent writing system known as the Khitan large script. For more information on the Khitan scripts, refer to Daniel Kane's "The Kitan Language and Script".

In phonology, vowel harmony is a phonological rule in which the vowels of a given domain – typically a phonological word – must share certain distinctive features (thus "in harmony"). Vowel harmony is typically long distance, meaning that the affected vowels do not need to be immediately adjacent, and there can be intervening segments between the affected vowels. Generally, one vowel will trigger a shift in other vowels, either progressively or regressively, within the domain, such that the affected vowels match the relevant feature of the trigger vowel. Common phonological features that define the natural classes of vowels involved in vowel harmony include vowel backness, vowel height, nasalization, roundedness, and advanced and retracted tongue root.

This project created an algorithm to separate the characters in the Khitan Small Script based on Peter Z. Revesz's paper.

## Data

The data folder contains several text files written in the [Khitan Small Script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khitan_small_script). They are written in the [Khitan Small Linear](https://www.babelstone.co.uk/Fonts/KhitanLinear.html) font where each character is written into its own separate square rather than conjoined into blocks for easier textual analysis. The text were taken from Kane 2009 book and other sources. Another version of the database can be found in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/reniven/khitan-small-script-database). 

## Input Method

If you need to input the Khitan Small Script using a keyboard, go to [KSS-Input](https://github.com/reniven/KSS-Input) for a input method I developed.
